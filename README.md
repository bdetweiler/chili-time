# chili-time
Pulls down Guckenheimer's menu for Union Pacific Center and tells me when there's chili.

If you're interested in knowing when there's chili in the Union Pacific cafeteria, you can simply add the URL to your calendar.

In Google Calendar, just go to Other Calendars and then **Add by URL**.

![Google Calendar - Add Calendar by URL](https://github.com/bdetweiler/chili-time/blob/master/googlecalendar.png "Google Calendar - Add Calendar by URL")

Enter the following URL: [http://bdetweiler.github.io/projects/chilitime/chilitime.ics](http://bdetweiler.github.io/projects/chilitime/chilitime.ics)


# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q. Why did you write this? Why don't you just look at their website?
What, pull up the website every day like some commoner? Psht. I didn't go through 8 years of computer science school to look at websites all day. \*scrolls listlessly through Facebook\*

## Q. Would you consider expanding this to other cafeterias?
If I ever work somewhere else, I will address the situation at that time.

## Q. What about other foods?
Sorry, I am only passionate about chili.
